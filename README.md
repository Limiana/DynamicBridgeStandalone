Or automatically put on a winter coat when you're going to a snowy place? With DynamicBridge, this is now possible!

## FAQ

- How do I set rule priority?
	- Rules are applied from the top down. 
	For example, the following rules would be listed in this order:
	1) "If I am in water, put on my swimsuit" 
	2) "If I am in a tropical biome, put on X"

	This way, when I go into the water it will put on my swimsuit and when I come out (if i am in a tropical area) it will put on my tropical outfit.
